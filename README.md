# Photo-Restoration-using-inpainting

Here in this project I have performed some photo restoration techniques of opencv. Here I have taken a damaged photo of Abraham Lincoln and I have implemented some photo restoration techniques to remove the damaged outline over the image and have produced a cleaned up image of Abraham Lincoln.

I have used inpainting method to remove noise and strokes in the photograph. The basic idea behind this is to replace those bad marks with its neighbouring pixels so that it looks like the neighbourhood.
