# Photo-Restoration-using-inpainting

Here in this project I have performed some photo restoration techniquescv. Here I have taken a damaged photo of Abraham Lincoln and I have implemented some photo restoration techniques to remove the damaged outline over the image and have produce a cleaned up image of Abraham Lincoln.

I have used inpainting method to remove noise and strokes in photographs.
